# MicroArray_Analysis_Visualisation
The following repository was created to understand the concepts of MicroArray data Analysis.

## Data
* Data was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database (__accession ID:__ GSE56133).
* __Platform Organism:__ *Escherichia coli*
* __Experiment type:__ Expression profiling by array
* __Data Format:__ .CEL
* __Overall design:__	WT or mutant *E coli* cells were grown to OD ~0.3. Untreated cells were harvested at time 0 as controls. Treated cells given the appropriate chemical perturbation and harvested 1 hour post-treatment. All experiments were performed in technical triplicate.
